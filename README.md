<p>Websockets</p>
<br>

## Brief
<br>
For the Capstone project, I worked independently to explore WebSocket technologies, such as socket.io and peerjs, by creating a video chat application. A rather ambitious task that went beyond the curriculum and provided a massive learning curve. This will remain by passion project until fully functioning.
<br><br>

### MVP
<br>
A user should be able to...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users will be able to log on by entering their name.</li>
    <li>Users will be able to join a room via a room name.</li>
    <li>Users will be able to create a room.</li>
    <li>Users will be able to Thave video chat with other users.</li>
    <li>Users will be able to leave a room â€“ which will redirect to homepage.</li>
    <li>A room should be able to host two users.</li>
</uL>
<br>


### Extensions:
<ul>
    <li>A room can host multiple users</li>
    <li>Users can join rooms with multiple users.</li>
    <li>Users can text other users with CRUD actions.</li>
    <li>Users can randomly join a room with strangers.</li>
    <li>Users can mute their microphone.</li>
    <li>Users can disable their camera.</li>
    <li>Host website on AWS.</li>
</ul>
<br>

This was a very ambitious task to complete within a two week period, and development process of this application is ongoing.
<br><br>

## Installation

<p>You'll need Express, socket.io, peerjs installed to run this.<p>
<br>

<p>You will need to run the front end, and two backend servers: express and peerjs<p>
